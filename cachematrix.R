## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

##makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.
##cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special “matrix” returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
##Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R.
##For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.





## Write a short comment describing this function

##The following functions are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and caches its inverse. The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special “matrix”, which is really a list containing a function to:
## 1.set the value of the matrix
## 2.get the value of the matrix
## 3.set the value of the inverse
## 4.get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	i <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
			  x <<- y
			  i <<- NULL
	}
	  get <- function() x
	  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
	  getinverse <- function() i
	  list(set = set,
		   get = get,
		   setinverse = setinverse,
		   getinverse = getinverse)
}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
	i <- x$getinverse()
	if (!is.null(i)) {
			  message("getting cached data")

	  data <- x$get()

	  x$setinverse(i)
	  i
